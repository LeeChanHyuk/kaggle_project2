I guess Brave was not meant to end his life there, he managed to meow softly which somehow caught my attention. I quickly picked him up and was shocked to see that Brave was so skinny and could barely walk. Brave's body was so cold and his eyes were half opened. Without any hesitation, I used a thick towel to wrap him up and tried to hand feed him with some wetfood,he refused to eat, fed him with some milk and water, he refused to drink, Brave was simply too weak to eat and drink. Brave was infected by a virus similar to that of parvo virus in a dog. That night, Brave was just lying and closed his eyes with heavy breath and i thought that he might not be able to make it to the next day. However, in the middle of the night, i heard a soft meow, it was Brave ! he was meowing to me ! he managed to raise up his little head eventhough he still could not stand up and walk. Immediately, i fed him some milk and water and he drank ! i monitored Brave's condition throughout the night (he was having severe diarrhea as well) and rushed him to the vet, Dr. Tan (2nd chance panel vet) the next morning. Dr. Tan said by looking at Brave's terrible condition and based on her experience, normally kitten infected with this kind of virus and with such a low body temperature as well as severe diarrhea, Brave had a very low chance to pull through. Brave was hospitalised and continue to be monitored and i, already prepared to receive call from the Dr. Tan anytime about the bad news on Brave, However, Brave has such a strong will to live, he began to perk up the next day, he can stand up and walk, he started to eat and drink by himself ! Yesterday, i dropped by at the clinic and Dr. Tan said that Brave's temperature has gone back to normal despite a bit of a diarrhoea. Brave not only ate and drank on his own, he even walked out from the cage and greeted me with a loud meow ! After a while, he started to groom himself ! What a joy! So, this is a wonderful and happy story about Brave and i hope that someone can foster Brave or better still, adopt him ! because Brave definitely deserves to be loved, doesn't he ? I hope that someone is kind enough to foster him. if he is not adopted, at least he is under the good hands of the fosterer and until the time that he is totally recovered and strong enough, i have to put Brave back to his colony. i hope Brave is fit and strong enough to be a community cat at my condo. Brave is really a miracle to me, he really wants to survive and he does ! Try to look at the pictures that i attached, his eyes are full of fighting spirit..........

The nice lady posted flyers around the area and asked all the Puchong vets about me but after 3 weeks no one has claimed me.

I do my potty on the grass or near drainhole covers - my carer thinks I was previously an indoor dog and perhaps potty trained to wee in the bathroom :) Since my past is unknown, I haven't been sent for neutering but please do the responsible thing and spay me after I go on heat if that happens.

If she is found to be intact (i.e. goes on heat), spay after her heat cycle ends. 5. Allow visits in the initial stages of adoption to ensure dog is adjusting well - for this reason adopters residing in Klang Valley are strongly preferred. 6.

The canine socialization period takes place between week 6 and 8, and is one of the most important stages of development of the dog. What they learn from their dam and littermates during this period greatly influences the rest of their lives. During this stage the puppies learn bite inhibition and canine socialization skills that are critical skills for a dog, and dogs that miss this stage often have behavioral problems which land them in shelters later in life. They may have serious problems getting along with other dogs, and can have problems with biting, because they never learn to adjust the pressure of their bite, and that teeth hurt.",4eb61ccb3,3.0,4

Don't ask me how I got stuck there, but I was so frightened, hungry and lost. I am safe now. My rescuer has put me on Avoderm and IAMS diet. She says I've got a good appetite. I have been Frontlined and dewormed too. I have just learned to use the litterbox, so give me a little bit more time and I'll be a pro at that (although my rescuer thinks I'm pretty good at it already)! My rescuer says that I'm very sweet. I've learned to warm up to humans and I love chin rubs and to be cuddled. I feel safe when I'm wrapped up in a blanket and held in someone's arms. I love to run after the cat teaser stick -- it's my favourite toy. I'm also quite good at playing the phone app for cats; it's cool...but nothing like giving the ol' feather stick a good chase! I promise I would make a wonderful kitty if I could grow up in a loving environment. The vet said I'm about 1.5 months old now and looking forward to a long and healthy life!

She is a good, alert watch dog, does not simply bark except for times when stranger is near the house. Understand basic commands like 'sit down', 'come here ' and when to start eating her food, does not bite things or shoes Advantage of adopting adult dog vs puppy: - Adult dogs are mature and character shown, as not all dogs have the character to watch a house (welcoming to all strangers without being alert), however Jolly is an alert watch dog that does not give in to people she is not familiar with. A good watch dog only works well if is not tie up or cage up whole day. - Adult dogs do not chew/ destroy things, not hyperactive or run around as compare to puppies - Female dog does not pee all around the house. They have set boundary for 'pee & poo' area - Adult dogs are more loving, easy to command as compared to puppy, and at this age, they would sit near to you just to watch you doing your things (they love companionship) Me and my husband love her very much, she has kept us feeling safe every night and she is a good company. The reason for us to give her away is due to moving, as the place that we are moving to does not allow us to keep dogs.

Initially we had someone who adopted her but, soon discovered that the owner is not a suitable candidate to have her. As guardians to this puppy, my husband and i felt that Marley needs a better environment and family. We have a 4-year-old Golden Retriever of our own that we rescued 2 years ago. We follow and practice the techniques of Cesar Millan and we are looking for suitable owners who are familiar with dogs to adopt Marley. Bob Marley is a 6 months old puppy; very playful, intelligent, alert and is a good watch dog. She likes to jog along with the handler. After awhile of getting to know you, you can walk or jog with her without a leash. As an advice, do bring along a leash anyhow. Golden Retriever puppies are hyper but will mellow down as it gets older from age 1 to 2 onward. Still, all dogs have their unique personality which you will come to know in time. This breed needs a cool environment due to its coat. They do well with owners who have big compound and lots of shades. For owners who prefer their dogs living indoor with them, this breed is also suitable for it, provided she can go out 2 to 3 times a day to do her business on grassy land. If you are unsure of this breed, do Google and study about this breed. We love this dog and we sincerely hope to find the best owner for her. Grooming is moderate.",50f87522f,5.0,1

Thank you! : D Roma was rescued as part of a 4-kitten litter from a backlane opposite my home on 20 August . After a month of fostering him to ensure that he is in good health and well socialised, he is now ready to be rehomed. - He was dewormed by a vet on 21 August (RM9) & 12 September (RM6) at a total cost of RM15. - He has been treated with Frontline spray on 21 August to protect against fleas for a month. - I'm feeding him with Vetri-DMG liquid supplement at 0.5mL twice a day. - I regularly trimmed his nails, cleaned his face with a saline solution and ears with Ilium Oticlean solution. - His weight is 0.55 kg as at 12 September . - He's eating Earthborn premium dry kitten kibbles. - He drinks water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kitten to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage his health and shorten his life. - He's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Ever Clean premium litter. - His poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as his overall health. - He has been vaccinated on 12 September at a cost of RM50. - His behaviour is perfect as a pet as he's completely domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. He would purr happily when held. He's friendly to other cats and kittens (but of course, they must accept him too) as he's well-socialised. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for Roma's future when you return to your home country. 2) Roma must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM65 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover the vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Roma. If possible, adopt Roma at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Roma, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first.

The vet says that he was quite small for his age, and not healthy enough to get vaccinated. Ultrasound scans show that his intestines have very thick lining, explaining why he was small (malabsorption) and had loose stool (maldigestion). After a few rounds of medication and gastro-intestinal kibbles, he's much better now. His coat is smooth and shinny. He has good appetite and his poop is normal now. He's been de-flea, dewormed, vaccinated (1st dose only), and castrated. He's tested negative for FIV and FeLV. Gus has short-medium coat. He has a particularly long and fluffy tail. The vet says that there might be some Maine Coon background as Gus has an oblong build. He's a loving cat with good temperament. He loves to sleep on my hand/arm while I work on the computer. He recognize people and can be wary of strangers. But warms up to people after some playtime together. He spends his days eating, sleeping and playing in my office.

She had been caught by municipal council dog catchers along with a large group of other dogs and puppies and was being held at the MPK (Majlis Perbandaran Klang) Dog Pound. Little Maddie is now staying with my during her rehabilitation. Her time at the pound was quite traumatizing and she had some insecurity issues and fear. She's a sweet, and friendly puppy now, eager to please and learn. She loves the company of people and her new friend Molly Sue. Maddie has been through some very rough times in her young life, i expect adopters to be patient and extra gentle with her. She needs to trust you and feel safe. Maddie doesn't like to be alone so it would be great if she could be adopted by someone with another friendly dog or someone that has time to spend at home. At the moment i am paper-training her because I am not home enough to expect her to be completely housebroken. I think Maddie may grow up to be quite a big dog so adopter should have space for her to run around in and time to take her for walks. vaccinations and spaying are compulsory for adoption. cost of these procedures to be borne by adopter. no caging, no tying up, no beating. adoption procedure for interested parties: - set up a meeting with me and maddie. - see if you and maddie get along. - i'll ask you some questions to make sure you are suitable for each other. - finally, meet up at my vet to pick up maddie and vaccinate her, then you can bring her home. interested parties can sms/call me at or Wani from MDDB at.

They were rescued by a jogger and other passersby and are now in the care of a few fosterers. Tabatha was seriously ill but has fully recovered. She's a survivor. She has a beautiful calico coat, long elegant tail, and big, green eyes. Tabatha is an inquisitive and intelligent kitten. Her curious nature makes her a mischievous tyke. She likes to follow people around and get involved with whatever they are doing. She loves playing with other cats and even cautiously hangs out with dogs. She is always running around, playing with toys and entertaining herself. She is quite vocal and very affectionate. Tabatha loves company and she would be terrific in a home with other cats or kittens and people who have time to spend with her. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Tabatha are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Tabatha is very sociable, playful, fun-loving, and energetic. Confining her in a small space would make her very unhappy.

We knew then that we needed to step in and help them! So we took them in. So far, we have managed to get 5 of them adopted and they are so loved and happy! We hope for a happy ending for Molek too!

Swagger loves his tin-foil ball, his mouse toy and a little bit of gentle wrestling. He also really loves his food and bowl of milk. A curious and adventurous animal, he loves exploring the world around him, but in the evening when he's exhausted he also likes to sleep on laps. When he gets excited, his beautiful long tail fluffs up like a mini Christmas tree. He likes to be scratched under the chin, and especially loves to have someone rub his white furry tummy.

Mei Xin jie jie is a very sweet girl and she will be playing with me when I get to my new home.I love her too! That's why mummy decided to let me live with them. _______________________________________________ Faith was a little tiny puppy when I found her wandering around.She had a bald tip tail and hind legs and could not walk properly thus we believed she was ill-treated from home and had no proper nutrition. So we brought her home and sent her to the vet. The vet said she was about 1 month plus old then. She was given medicine and dewormed but not heart guard as she was too tiny. She's now healed with LOTS OF HAIR!! and very healthy. We are a couple staying in a rented home with neighbours who complain about our dogs let free in the compound.Therefore Faith lives in a cage whenever we're off to work and out of home. I am now not working but will soon be working again. Also, due to our financial status, we're not able to to provide proper nutrition to all the animals thus we have decided to let go Faith the youngest dog which needs the nutrition and a proper growing envinroment most. Faith is toilet trained and she's fleas/ticks/mites free. TOILET TRAINED - She might let go at the wrong place due to new environment. ------------------------------------------------- Dear Wonderful pet lovers, I have received many calls regarding Faith this whole day and am happy to know that there are so many of you out there who are interested in adopting her. There's a question I must answer to every phone call and I should state it here clearly. YES,ADOPTING FAITH IS FREE! YOUR PRICE TO PAY IS TO GIVE MY LITTLE MONSTER PROPER CARE AND A LOVING HOME. Please also note that Faith is a growing puppy therefore she's very playful and active - running around.This is the only thing I am worried about.

Condition: Healthy and Pregnant (Probably will deliver in early May). Believed that this is not the first time she is pregnant. Characteristics: Adorable. Soft. Very affectionate dan sangat manja. Likes to purr a lot. Likes to roll her self on the floor:) Sangat comel bila dia golek-golekkan badan dia atas lantai;) Likes to clean herself frequently. Even with a bulging stomach, she is still a playful mama and like to play:) Why she needs to be adopted asap: Cause the Cat Catcher of my hostel block has started their cat cat catching operation and they may take Mama Kin away to unknown-unsafe place..worse, according to the Cat Catcher,the cats that they have captured will be taken to the zoo negara. Mama Kin's story: Mama Kin is a stray cat that came to my hostel block about two months ago, out of nowhere, right after Mega and her kids have left us. When we started to approach Mama Kin, we noticed that she is an adult cat and she is also pregnant. Without any bias or judgment, yet with with warm hearts, we welcome her to our lives and to this hostel block. Kami namakan dia Mama Kin sebab kaki dia ada 'white spots' that make her looks as if dia pakai stokin;) She is a pretty, adorable and cute pregnant mummy cat. She has been a very good and affectionate cat too. Dia sangat manja. She likes to purr a lot every time I play with her, caress her head, stroke her fur and give her some food. Despite the fact that we love having her around, we know that ""some people"" don't like it. Dan ""some people"" yang dimaksudkan di sini ialah ""the hostel management people"". Just like other cases of cats in this hostel block, we do fear that Mama Kin will be taken away by the Cat Catcher assigned by the hostel management sooner or later. Kalau kucing-kucing ini diambil dan dibawa ke tempat seperti SPCA ke, saya tak kisah. But the Cat Catcher once told me that the cats that he has captured will be brought to zoo negara or somewhere unknown. I totally don't want these cats to be taken to zoo negara or anywhere else that's not safe. Therefore, me and my friends realize that one day we need to find Mama Kin a new owner and release her from this ""cat hater"" place. So, we at first plan to give her away for adoption after she has given birth. Unfortunately, the day that we fear has come. This morning, the Cat Catcher came to my hostel and he and the team searched high and low for any cats, just any cats whether it's the one that has been neutered or not. However, thank God, Alhamdulillah and I'm so grateful that some of my friends who are also cat lovers managed to act quickly and managed to save and hide other cats in some rooms and Mama Kin is now hiding in my room. And this is not the end. They will come again soon cause they know, the cats that they are searching for are not captured today. With all this panic moment and in such dangerous state, I think I can't wait until Mama Kin has delivered. I can't wait after her delivery. It's going to take longer time and her life is 'at stake' now, if I may put it that way. So, I'm putting up Mama Kin's profile in here, so that anybody who's a true cat lover, kind-hearted, considerate and caring out there could have the heart to adopt her. Please... Yes, she is pregnant. And the person who would love to adopt her must be the one who is prepared and ready for new comers. If that person doesn't plan to have them all, perhaps you could be patient for awhile and later, you could give them away for adoption once the kittens are big enough. I'm searching for someone who really really appreciates cats whether they are adults or kittens. Why I say this is because, when I 'advertise' Mega and her kitten not long ago,I found out some people like to have the kittens yet abandon the mother. There was this one couple who intended to adopt Mega and one of her kittens. Tapi this couple told me that they live in an apartment. So what they plan to do is to keep the kitten but put Mega downstairs with other stray cats. Kalau macam tu, apa guna saya iklankan untuk Mega di'adopt'. Baik saya 'buang' saja Mega ke zoo negara seperti yang dilakukan oleh Cat Catcher di hostel block saya ni. So, basically, all I'm asking and hoping for is to have a cat lover who is responsible and caring to take good care of the pregnant and adorable Mama Kin which deserves to feel loved and be happy in a safer place, as soon as possible. That's all. Please... Thank you=)",b6fbfa344,12.0,2

My foster mummy Lyn found me all alone in the driveway of a vacant house on jalan sri hartamas 2 on saturday september 12 after receiving a phonecall about an abandoned kitten. I was curled up in a tight ball and didn't move when she touched me and spoke to me. I was covered in filth and looked dead. The lady that called her about me told her that my siblings and cat mummy used to all live in that empty house together but then my mummy moved away and took my siblings with her.. i think she forgot about me. the people in the house next door watched and waited for her to come back but she didnt.. that's when they called for help because they knew i was dying. I have been with my foster mummy for almost 2 weeks now and i'm feeling much better though i haven't grown much. I'm still too thin and i don't like the kitten milk formula very much. I really hate the milk bottle so i have to be syringe fed for now. I hope my teeth grow soon so I can start eating yummy canned kitten food and kibble! Mummy Lyn wants to keep me forever but she can't coz she has soooo many pets now. I hope someone will adopt me and love me like she does. I should be able to go to my new home in about 3 to 4 weeks, once i am completely weaned and litter trained. Mummy lyn wants me to be healthy, so my new parents will have to pay for my vaccinations and they must neuter me because there are already too many homeless hungry kittens like me struggling in the streets and suffering.. For adoption to a safe and loving home. Preferably INDOOR only. Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months are COMPULSORY. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT please unless during instances of illness or injury. Adoption procedure: - Set up a meeting with me and Pinky. - See if potential adopter and Pinky are suitable for each other. I will ask some questions to make sure adopter is suitable. - Succesful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get Pinky vaccinated before being able to take Pinky home. Cost of vaccination and neutering to be borne by adopter. - I might occasionally ask adopter for updates to see how Pinky is doing. Interested parties can sms, or email me. Serious enquiries only please. A description of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated.

Bambi is very intelligent also. She knows to pee and poo most of the time on rag and newspaper without training. But she's a very manja girl and love to stick with human, when she can't see any people around her she will feel insecure and cry. But when you're with her, she will just be very quiet and sit or sleep beside you. A very sweet little baby! Adopter need to be patient with her at the beginning as she's still a little baby now, she can be trained to be independent after a period.

Hailey was rescued about 2 months ago in Desa Sri Hartamas. She was a lone pup most likely abandoned. Hailey was close to death when she was rescued. Severely malnourished and anemic she could barely stand. She had major hookworm infestation and the worse case of fleas I had ever seen. It was heartbreaking to see such a tiny little dog endure so much. Her blood count was so low that a blood transfusion was needed. But like her vet says..Hailey is a fighter and a survivor! She was such a good patient throughout her treatment and rehabilitation. It was so easy to administer her meds and when she got her appetite back she would eat anything I fed her..no complaints, no rejection . Thankfully, she is now a happy and healthy girl. She is also very intelligent. She learned the commands sit and down in a day and would go back to her cage when she's instructed to. Although it breaks my heart to give her up for adoption, I feel she deserves much more than what a condo habitat can offer. Hailey received her first vaccination a few days ago and is due for her 2nd in a month. Her adoption is only open to genuine dog lovers who will take her in as part of the family . Adopter must agree to spay her in February before her first heat. If you are keen on giving Hailey her forever loving home, please contact Kin at.",bfdff0622,3.0,4

Luckily for the puppy he managed to dodge the in coming car just in time. The puppy was so shaken and i decided to bring him home for temporary care, he was so hungry that he finish up all the food in just seconds and of course after the meal it was time to take a good and nice hot bath. I was unable to care for this puppy for long time as i'm staying at a apartment and i have a 9 months old female mongrel dog with me, which i rescue her 6 months ago when her owner decided to leave her alone by the road side. To my surprise my female dog seems to enjoy the male puppy company, well maybe they share the same fate as a mongrel and stray around by the roadside and so my female dog decided to treat the small male puppy nice. The puppy was a very active dog, he likes to follow me around where ever i go and when i keep him in a cage or when he does not see me around for a short period of time he whine and whine until he fall asleep. Anyway i sincerely hope that someone can adopt the male puppy and give him a nice warm home.. . anyone who is interested,sincere and serious to give the puppy a new home can contact me anytime, please find below my detail.thank you",48d1e6446,2.0,1

He was clearly lost, and was frightened and confused. After spending ages trying to calm him down, we managed to get him home. Unfortunately he did not get along with one of our foster dogs at all. So we had to board him at our vet while we tried to locate his family. We have had no luck so far as no one has come forward to claim him although his picture has been shared alot and we have also put up posters in the area where we found him and in the surrounding tamans. He has however, been miserable at the vet and has refused food since Sunday. He has also been howling and trashing himself against the cage, trying to get out. We managed to get another foster carer today (/14) and he is feeling much better at the foster carer's place. We have discovered that he's okay with female dogs and puppies :) but dislikes adult male dogs. Buster is a really sweet dog and loves to sit and cuddle in your lap. He loves car rides too and would sit in your lap and look out the window quite happily. Buster needs to be in a home environment with someone who will give him lots of cuddles and love.

Message from Ex-foster mummy: With a heavy heart I must find her a good home where she is allowed to be dog and be happy. She has been through a lot, I only wish the best for her. Will care for her till she get a home. Terms and Condition: There will be an Adoption fee, PM me and we'll go through a interview process, if successful home visit must be allowed before handing over the dog. Bi-monthly home visit to check up on the dog. Health status: Mild Hip Dysplasia, other than that overall healthy spayed, vaccinated. Location: currently in Ipoh (grandma's house) Summary: I’m Freya Tumbleweed a 7 year old Belgian Shepherd Malinois. I was previously a skinny 13kgs, malnourished abandoned dog found on the streets in Klang until a kind hearted Samaritan found me and posted up about me on Facebook requesting for help. Foster mummy’s friend responded and took me to a vet and a couple of days I was handed over to my foster mummy. I was diagnosed with HeartWorm thankfully it was only Stage 1, I was put on a safer treatment a combination of Doxycycline and HeartGard (Ivermectin) for 6 months. I stayed in foster mummy’s care for close to a year, making sure I was totally recovered and was then send for spaying, I was suspected to be used for breeding. I couldn’t stay too long at foster mummy’s house mainly it was because I couldn’t get along with 2 out of 4 dogs that live there and I had to stay indoors leashed because of foster mummy’s cats safety ( I still had my daily twice a day walks though) and foster mummy and family felt bad for me. On the 11th of November I was send to my foster mummy’s ( now ex-foster mummy) grandma’s house which is 2 hours away since they were looking for another dog to help watch over the house. I managed to adapt myself to my new environment pretty quick. Unfortunately on the 14th of December, I managed to escape the backyard fence through a hole I managed to find and escape to find my friend ( nobody was at home except Grandma). Grandma spotted me and wanted to bring me back, I got a little overzealous over grandma trying to leash me I accidentally caused my grandma to fall (she is in recovery but slow). Grandma now prefers I go back with Ex-foster mummy and other family agree for the sake of her safety. Ex-foster mummy says I’m overall a good/watch dog but I get overzealous at times and I like to jump hug people that is kind of a problem. Long story short Ex-foster mummy is now looking at finding me a new home that has a nice size compound and family that will give me the LOVE/ATTENTION/DISCIPLINE/EXERCISE I need. I get on well in general with other dogs provided they are nice and friendly; I DON’T do well with AGGRESSIVE/CRAZY/DOMINANT DOGS. I will definitely love my humans maybe a tad bit too much, I get along with children (preferably 10 years old and above). I have mild Hip Dysplasia, I will need to take Glucosamine daily.

We decided to bring him to our office and get him used to people, which wasn't a problem at all. And to litter train him,which was every easy to do as long as the litter box is cleaned at least twice a day. He really doesn't like a dirty litter box He enjoys exploring and doing his ""rounds"" around the office and play outdoors (done under strict supervision), once he is done with that he just likes to chill out and look good and handsome. He is very mellow and will follow you everywhere just like your shadow. He loves being around people and being given lots loving attention. He also loves to chat and is fairly vocal which, we believe, is due to Morrison having either Siamese or Burmese blood in him. If you want a quiet or silent cat Morrison isn't right for you. The adopter should have a home with an enclosed yard which is cat proofed as Morrison does enjoy a little romp around the yard and, if given the chance the neighbourhood. Safety is very important so that Morrison can give his love to his guardian. Morrison may be an ""older"" cat but trust me he has a wonderful personality and will make a great and loving companion to anyones home.

The 1st owner told us that they no longer have time to take care of pet and since then, Jacker stay with us and start his new life. Jacker's very very scared of human touch when we first found him. He kept trembling when we get near him and get frightened when you've big action. We're not sure what kind of bad experiences he went through but we're pretty sure that both of his ex-owner didn't treat him good!

She is sadly Heartworm positive and will be treated for it..She was officially fostered on the 13th of Feb and will be under the care of a very kind samaritan for 2 months. We hope a suitable person would come forward to welcome her with open arms with a forever home..we know she is at that age but has been through a lot. Can you imagine having a choke collar on yourself, your whole life? See the 'rafia' tied on her choke collar? Yes, I got it snipped off and hopefully the fosterer would be able to get her choke collar off. What is wrong with human beings! The Starbucks trip could wait, Starbucks won't go anywhere. Even if one Starbucks gets demolished, more would appear..But there are billions of animals in need and there will always be one buddy or clara or we will call her every loving name in the entire world!..Just like there is only one of us out of the billions of people out there. If you want a dog that is just there as an accessory or if you just want a dog that is healthy, I guess you don't have to read further but I hope the least you could do is place yourself in her shoes and share about her. I been asked if her chances of being adopted is high. I don't have a crystal ball people, I'm not God either so your question is bizarre to me, but as bleak as it may seem to many of you, I want to remain hopeful that a responsible and caring adopter would come forward wanting to care for her like a child who would stand by their elderly parent with ailments. Buddy was sent to me I believe..God had a task for me on that day. That day where a man cockily rang the bell and asked me to place water for the dog. Of course I would though I was put off by him. Man claimed dog followed him from the bus stop but he was reluctant to stay even for one minute with the dog while I gathered the food, the water? Doesn't click. Dog wanders up and down..people, hah, people were so unkind in general. I could go 'excuse me sir, excuse me, excuse me maam' and what? They just ignored me. To top it off, employer appeared displeased with the dog's presence, but adviced on placing food at the bus stop and just letting her wander off. If one knows me well enough, such 'advices' goes into into my left ear, out through my right ear. I made calls in secrecy. Managed to find a neighbour of this kind couple who housed her for two nights. 8 am the next day, I had to collect her. Would be at work with me but I was only allowed to place her outside of the clinic (yup, I work in an animal clinic indeed). Imagine the scorching heat, imagine the thunder, the rain and I couldn't. Mind you, couldn't even board her. Not because I had no money. I was simply not allowed to. As shitty as that was, good thing, I went by what I stood for and I wasn't a moron to listen to such advices. I've my own personal values. I would have slept with her outside of the clinic at night if that was what it took even because no way was I going to leave her to fend for herself. Thankfully a kind lady contacted me through the internet and agreed to foster her for 2 months. So again fellow Malaysians or expats or people holidaying here etc, before you go for your next Starbucks fix or debating on what clothes to buy, please take a moment and reflect on this. The fosterer and me are really hoping we could find a suitable person to give her a permanent home...We want the end of her days to be filled with love, compassion... If you are that person, please contact me Yasmin at. Its best for you to sms me first because I work such long hours. More pictures and any necessary updates will be provided. We can't predict what will happen within this two month period but..we do need fosterers as a back up.. So please, we could end up like Clara..alone, lost, left to wander about when we're old, hoping for the mercy of another human being. Think about it. Someday, we could be sitting outside of Starbucks, begging for dough..from the outside, looking in and all of the 'too caught up with the Starbucks buzz' people who reminded you of yourself when you were younger would all turn a blind eye at you and hey, remember back then that dog you didn't want to give your time for? Reality would blow you real hard when you see a dog wandering on the streets, comforting you. Just think about it. Its no Hollywood script. Its reality. Think about it. If what I just wrote does hit you somewhere, then hit me up. Otherwise, just turn the page. Kindly, Yasmin",f3b52a69c,4.0,2

She was very weak, starving, cold and most probably she barely had strength to move but when we tried to help her she responded with a domesticated attitude. We brought her home from the rain because we know she would die if we didn't help. when we brought her home she responded quite affectionate. However she wasn't very active cause she was still very tired and also had a slight limp. She looks like she is a american eskimo although I doubt she is a pure breed. When we found her she wasn't smelly even. when she was fully soaked. Which lead us to conclude that she hasn't been homeless for more than 5 days. We have asked around the neighbourhood to try to find the owner, however we feel that she was abandoned. Our situation dosnt allow us to permanently adopt her since we are students with a very limited income. As well as we are already caring for a beautiful dog who we rescued 3 years ago. She already seems well mannered and obeys when prompted to sit. The only negative we noticed is that she guards her food with an attitude. We think this is because she may had had to defend for her self when she was out on the street. Additionally she got along fine with our dog after the initial excitement of being introduced.

You will also have the opportunity to speak to the vet and understand his condition prior deciding. As it's always in all our adoption, here are the guidelines : a) Adopter must be an animal lover. b) No long hour of caging or tied on leash. c) Provide necessary medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) d) Clean and healthy living environment e) Add us on facebook so we can follow-up on his progress. f) This is a non-transferrable case.

Two weeks ago MPSJ dog catcher came over to catch stray dogs at my house area. One female dog got abandoned here few months ago and she has been here for so long. She stays at my street right in front of my neighbors house. The reason was my neighbors dog made her pregnant and since then she was there with 7 puppies, right in front of the husbands house. I love her but I cannot take her in coz I already have four. That day she almost got caught. So I told myself if she comes back safe from her hiding place I will rescue her. Praise The Lord that she came back safe that evening. I took her in and showered her. My neighbor told me that all her puppies are either dead or got caught. She is now vaccinated, spayed and dewormed. Blood test at the vet also showed healthy status. I need someone to adopt her. Or maybe if you can't adopt just help me to foster her till I find her a new home. I can't release her back on the street as I travel very often for work and I don't want her to be caught when I am not around. Please share this message to ppl you know who wants a dog too.

He is a great companion especially for eldery person. He was found on the street looking extremely skinny and malnourished. His owner dumped him and the poor fella being a home pet wasn't able to fend for himself. He has been nursed back to health and ready for adoption. Adopter ideally needs to have large compound for the dog to run around and daily walk is needed. No adoption fee but we seek for kibbles to be donated to our food supply in feeding the strays. 2 bag of combo at RM each and you may donate more if wish to. This dog has special diet requirement. He has to be fed on grain free and we recommend wild avoderm salmon grain free. Our requirement is simple : a) Adopter must be an animal lover. We don't want the dog to end up again on the street. b) No long hour of caging or tied on leash. c) Provide necessary medical attention d) Plenty of exercise and daily walk. You can view the dog before deciding. Trial adoption is available.** If you keen to find out more, please contact me. ** Subject to terms and condition 1st update : The dog is currently on trial adoption. The family seems to like him very much. Thank you for your interest. If the dog is available for adoption, we will contact those who have put in their interest with us earlier. 2nd update : This dog has been a permanent family member of the foster.

Please read on to understand more about me."" -------------------------------------------------------------------- Details: - Female, 10 months old, mix of Coon (father) and Ragdoll (mother). Has a beautiful white + fawn coat with blue eyes. Character: - Fayja is a very loving girl and ADORES people. She has an outgoing personality and will adjust to any situation really quick. Loves to play, play, play and hardly tires herself at every invite! She enjoys being pet, stroked and even kissed (although not a fan of being carried). She will come to you when she wants a lap to lie on (she will struggle off if made to do so). - Fayja has a tendency to get overexcited whenever she sees humans and will roll around, purr and sometimes play-bite. She knows how to inhibit herself, however and will lick you afterwards. This instant excitement is probably from her previous life mostly caged - and lack of attention. She understands a simple firm ""no"" in such circumstances. - She has a jealous streak around other cats although she is curious (big NO for kittens), will do best as a single cat. She dislikes others being stroked or pampered in her presence, will lay herself and nuzzle as close as possible to her person to prove this point. - Fayja has been vaccinated, dewormed, spayed and given Advocate spot-on. She is not at all fussy about food and is very clever with the litter box. *** Note For Potential Adopters (PLEASE READ) *** - Fayja ""nips"" as a show of affection very often, hence experienced adult owners preferred (homes with children will not be suitable). - She needs a % indoor home. NO apartments (unless you have maintained a cat-safe environment for many years). - Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire for more info, this is for any cats long term welfare. - Small reimbursement fee will apply, please inquire. Health card will be passed to successful adopter.

We found the poor thing on the 1st of January in our garage. She was starving and was trying to get close to any cats or humans she would see. She was in a pretty good health then we understood that she got either lost or abandoned. The vet has confirmed that she had a family before as she is behaving like a house cat: friendly, cuddly, litter-trained and responsive to contacts. We dewormed her, neutered her, treated her against fleas and we made sure she regained the weight she lost. She is really easy to handle, didn’t complain when the vet checked her and when giving her treatment against worms. She got a flu but she is all clear from it since a month thanks to the proper medication. She is as perfect as she can be. She has a beautiful grey-orange colour and her eyes are bright orange. A gem! She also have some Singapura features. She won’t be a big cat (unless you ive her tons of food). She looooooves cuddles and to stick around her humans. Unfortunately for her, we already have 4 big cats and it is not enough attention to her taste. It is not fair for her as she is craving for attention and quality time with us. She loves cuddling up against our legs to have a nap. If you let her do it, she will spend the whole night against you and will follow you everywhere. She is not a kitten anymore but she has the same level of cuteness! We often rescue cats and find them a loving family. Sandy will probably be the most love-giving one we would have saved so far. As a cat rescuer, I will be careful to find the good match for her. She will be happy in a family, with or without other cats. We have a strict policy of NO caging. Please be aware that a cat is a long term engagement (a cat can live an average of 15 years). So if you think that Sandy is THE one, I will be happy to introduce her to you.",74d7a26bc,9.0,3

She is active, loves kids, loves adults, basically just anyone she can play with. She is alert against strangers approaching the house, hence a good guard dog. She is friendly towards anyone near to her owner, hence a good friend. She is friendly towards every member of the house, hence a good house dog. She is toiler trained. She can do it on grass and newspapers. She is obedient, and manja. She never bites. She is happy when people are around.

She is a perfect dog everywhere. She sits still in cars, and doesnt jump around. She is a good passenger too. I love her very very much. Its very very sad to leave her for adoption, but I have no choice. I have to move to a house where no dogs are allowed. All places I asked do not allow dogs. I have no idea how. I really wish someone with a good heart for dogs can take her in. She is up for adoption from today onwards.

He would purr when being stroked. He would eat treats from my hand. He would follow me around at home and rub against me. He can get along with other cats.

I dashed out and grabbed him then picked up sweet pea and off we went to the vet! What a miserable trio we were. Both kittens were weak, dehydrated, and sickened by awful intestinal infections. Poor sweet pea had scratches on her face probably from a run-in with an adult cat. Little oliver was bleeding from his mouth and bled all over my skirt. The good news is they're both well on the road to complete recovery thanks to my regular vets. Sweet pea is about 3 months old with a white coat and pretty eyes. Oliver is a growing 6 week old Marmalade male with a tiny midget tail. They're playful rascals who like to wrestle with each other and enjoy a nice warm cuddle with people. These two needs lots of attention and responsible, caring families to care for them. They need PERMANENT homes. Vaccinations and neutering/spaying are compulsory for adoption.

She was really frail and quite dirty with a skin condition, and was looking for a kind person to cuddle up to and not so much for food. But of course Malaysians being Malaysians, most of them shoo-ed her away and some even kicked her. The coffee shop owner then informed me that her mother had recently been killed - someone had poisoned her. As I usually have a small amount of dog food with me in the car, I gave her some. She ate a little but just wanted to be petted. She then went to another table curled up at the feet of this old man. Thankfully this man did not kick her. I asked several people if they would take her, but of course none would. In the end, I asked the shop owner for a box and brought her home. I just could not bring myself to leave her there. I took her to the vet and it was confirmed that she had a severe case of sarcoptic mange. She was treated with Ivermectin for 5 weeks and she is now a healthy, active puppy. We're not entirely sure what breed she is, but she looks like she could have some Jack Russell in her and possibly some Dalmation as well as she has quite a lot of spots... She has just received her first vaccination and will be completing the remaining 2 shots soon. She has a very good temperament and is good with other dogs. She is curious about our cat and has shown no signs of aggression towards it. She is very playful and is a fast learner.

Has marbled fur and beautiful orange eyes. Father was a pure Maine Coon and mother a DLH (see final pics). ♥ Surrendered to us with a rather bad fungal issue several months back which he has since fully recovered from. He is now seeking a suitable new family. Character: ♥ Ferauni is a frisky boy who adores people to bits - however he will need time to adjust to both a new environment + new cats (as long as they are not aggressive). Constant attention and the presence of humans round the clock makes this process a quick one. ♥ When he's not rolling on the sofas purring, acting cute or asking for belly rubs - he LOVES to play. Feather and string toys are his favourite and he has quite some speed and jumping skills to show off. He even ""coo-s"" and knows how to speak (meow) back when spoken to. ♥ Ferauni loves being cuddled to sleep. He's still learning to stay put while being carried (normally jumps off) but otherwise parks himself super close to us whenever possible. He is very responsive to being called and follows us everywhere around the house. ♥ Ferauni is healthy (has completed two vaccine shots + two Revolution spot on treatments, aside from his medical maintenance). He is very clever with the litter-box and not fussy at all about dry or wet food. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** ○ Ferauni must be kept % indoors for his own safety. Apartments must be cat-safe. ○ Neutering is a MUST when he's older. There are far too many homeless kittens out on the streets. ○ Ferauni would prefer premium food (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire if unsure, this is for his long term welfare. ○ A reimbursement FEE will apply for his partial medical cost + neutering deposit, please inquire. Please drop me a text over on WhatsApp if you feel that you may be just the right person to take this boy home. Details on your past experience with cats will be much appreciated.

My family and I have been nurturing her back to good health and training her with basic command. Unfortunately we are unable to foster her for an extended duration of time because of our working culture. She has the potential to be a worthy dog, as such I am looking for the best option for her. This shall be a process for adoption, as a friendly reminder, this is NOT a process of buying-selling. Whereby, a second visit shall be considered as conclusive that both of the adopter’s and c’mie criteria fits each other. By the end of this week .. the decision for the adoption will be made. I’m pleased to answer further questions regarding her characteristics and behaviour. As a general overview, she is an energetic, adventurous and fast-learning puppy. At time she is stubborn, vocal (She now has better control of excitement, she is not aggressive) and pleads with you thru the trick of the trade for being a puppy. She behaves well when you are grooming her, if she behaves otherwise, all she needs is time to relax beforehand. She requires a compound and daily walks. Preferably she is adopted by a family with basic knowledge of caring for a dog, a family with children and a family that is inclined for outdoor activities. She would require training to be an obedient dog as she possesses the traits of a dominant dog. Above all else, she reacts best with positive reinforcement. She is more likely to grow bigger but not taller. Her best features is her paws, it is strong and sturdy. Adoption fees RM includes Hills prescription diet I/D (More or less sufficient for July), Ear Drops, Ears Cleaning Fluid, Dog Bowl, Collar (She was found with this collar, would require a bigger collar when she grows bigger) and leash and Dog Bowl. If the adopter does not have a dog cage, I’m willing to provide mine for RM, as it is intended to be donated to the ASPCA. ********** End of Update ********** A puppy with RED collar was found at Padang Merbok. She was wandering about until my group of friends decided to play with her. During the drive to SPCA, it is apparent that she has experience being in the car. SPCA has placed her under the waiting list for adoption. A trip to the vet has confirmed that she has has negative result in both distemper and parvo cvirus. However, she does have an extended stomach as she has not been eating well. Within 2 weeks of regular feeding, it would allow her to return to good health. A treatable physical ailment is that she does have ear mites. Her ears are now cleaned daily coupled with the administration of ear drops. Now that she feels at comfort, it is apparent that she is an intelligent dog that would requires obedience and discipline. She is potentially a good guard dog, respective to the general traits of a German Shepard Dog. She DOES know that there are certain things that would get her into trouble. She will proceed with guilty eyes and plead vocally with you. She chooses to relief herself outdoors, groom herself post-walk. As of yet, there are no listing found for her. Her owner is still being sought after. Due to the extensive working hours during the weekday and marathon training during the weekend, I am unable to foster her for an extended period of time. She would be well suited for an active lifestyle.",6469a2a4a,5.0,2

She wasn't sure when the kittens were placed there, but she knew the poor kittens had at least traveled one journey in there, probably traumatized beyond belief. Since the lady did not know how long the kittens were there, she could not know where they came from and where their mother is, and this is when my aunt called me for help. I named them Nobu (the white one) and Yoshi (the orange one) after Japanese warlords Nobunaga and Hideyoshi. Strong names for two strong boys. Nobu had an eye infection at the time of rescue, but had cleared up now with eye ointment. Both kittens had also been dewormed at the same time. They are currently about 1.5 months old to be accurate. I had successfully weaned them off milk, and they can eat kibbles on their own now. (RC baby kitten) Though they do still enjoy milk on the occasion. They are litter trained, though can still get messy at times kicking litter all over. Yoshi the orange tabby is the older brother, the bigger of the two. He has the CUTEST round eyes and can be quite manja. He is more mild mannered compared to Nobu, but is a fast learner. He purrs loudly. Nobu is the younger one but he is also the adventurous one. He is extremely curious and likes to explore wherever he can get to via whatever method he can. (jump, climb etc) However, he can be a bit messy, spilling kibbles all over, getting milk beards, stepping into the water bowl etc. He has a super cute 'mew' though! Both kittens are extremely playful, Yoshi especially LOVES to play with feathers. They can also be potential lap cats. I used to bottle feed milk to them on my lap sitting on a small stool, even though I don't now since they broke their milk bottle, sometimes they still like to climb onto my lap and I'll pet them. ******SERIOUS ADOPTERS ONLY****** - It would be most preferable if they can be adopted together, I don't want to split the two brothers since they are quite attached to each other. - They must be spayed at the age of 6-8 months. - The brothers must be kept INDOORS since they do not grow up on the streets and are not street smart.

She knows how to inhibit herself however and understands a simple firm ""no"" in such circumstances. - Meshira gets along with other sociable / aloof adult cats (those that aren't aggressive) and kittens. She can adjust to dogs as well. Territorial or aggressive adult cats are a big no. - Meshira has been vaccinated, dewormed and spayed. She's not at all fussy about food and is good with the litter box. *** Note For Potential Adopters (PLEASE READ) *** - Meshira ""nips"" as a show of affection hence adult owners or homes with older children preferred (seasoned cat people). - She needs a % indoor home. No apartments (unless you have maintained a cat-safe environment for many years). - Premium diet must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc).

Both grew up together so they are very attached together. Most of the times they are very quiet either sleeping together or exploring together but when they see me, they will start calling and approach careful at first. - Both are around 1.5 months to 2 months old (Jun ) Video and images are attached.

She was nearly run down by a vehicles while i had my breakfast and since it is not safe for her to be on the street i decided to foster her while looking for potential adopter. She is very playful and at a stage where she like to chew and bite on stuff so the adopter needs to train her and be patient, all puppiesd are cute but requires a lot of patience and discipline but rest assured once they have matured they will learn to be more docile but the adopter plays a major role in this. A minimum fee of RM is needed for her spaying/neutering operation when she is 6 months old to prevent future pregnancies and diseases such as uterus cancer, so please bear in mind the adoption fee is mainly used for Minnie's operation and welfare.

I was born in the bushes somewhere in Sri Petaling on the 9th September . I was sent to PAWS Mission shelter in early November and was fostered shortly after that by Richard. When Richard took me home, I was quite sick and was quickly taken to the Vet clinic where I was diagnosed with tick fever and put on blood transfusion immediately. I had to stay overnight at the clinic, which terrified me. I remember the vet telling Richard that I was whining a fair bit in my cage. After a few more vet visits and with lots of medication (yuckkhh!!) and supplements, I feel much, much better now. That was 2 months ago. I now have a very healthy appetite and weigh about 6.5 kg. Richard has been feeding me kibbles (with cod liver oil & supplement topping), canned food and rice cooked with liver and chicken(yummy!!). I also get those occasional treats when I'm able to follow some simple instructions like sit and shake hands (Shhh - don’t tell anyone but I am only doing this so that I can get the goodies ). I'm also very energetic now and enjoy running around in the yard and playing fetch the ball/bone/tree branch with Richard. I was vaccinated on 20th December after given a clean bill of health by the vet. As Richard is unable to look after me permanently :(, I am looking to be part of a loving new family :). I am very affectionate, intelligent and loyal – I won’t try to leave home. Like most puppies though, I occasionally love shoes & slippers, digging dirt to bury my goodies and playfully nip Richard’s hand (he knows I’m just playing with him). I am still maturing and like human kids need to be shown where my boundaries are. If you like my story and would like to adopt me as part of your family, please call Mrs. Lai at or Richard at .

We spotted one huge open wound that a fly just went there to settle itself and didnt come out.. It was a late evening, on a saturday, most vet around our area already closed, so we took her to MediVet Hospital in Jalan Tun Razak. Doctor found about 4 maggot wounds on her, one near her left ear, 3 near the tail area. She had to be hospitalized for 4 days, did blood work as well as viral test, which she was negative for. She was anemic and her heart was weakened due to the prolonged infection. She even had to be force-fed with the IV on. Now she is so much more energetic with good appetite! Her suturing was done as well, medication is on for 7 days prior to her discharge on the 19th. Frigga is a very manja girl, who is quite obedient for a stray..she even waited for you to walk first when you walk her. She gets a little anxious when you leave her on her own, but as long as she can roam around the house she does not whine so much. But all in all, she is really a lovable sweet girl..I cant keep her because my father doesnt tolerate dogs. It was fortunate enough after much talk from my mom he agreed to let her stay for 10 days.
